# KICKSTARTING WITH EXCEL

## OVERVIEW

From over 4000+ plays listed along with their goal, pledged amount and outcomes various quantities were calculated and plotted.

### PURPOSE

The purpose of this project was to find out how different fundrising campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## ANALYSIS AND CHALLENGES

### CHALLENGES AND DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED

* The dataset itself had extensive values and seiving through only the essentials held the key.
* To get going from count 0 was not easy, figuring out where and how to start took some time (especially whan you are new to such big set of data) [Unix Timestamp Help] (https://support.ecreators.com.au/hc/en-us/articles/360001177136-Unix-Timestamp-to-Date-Format#:~:text=The%20generic%20formula%20to%20convert,is%20located%20in%20cell%20B5.)
* Finding the exact formulae for time conversion (Timestamp converter) especially when you have never come across such a conversion ever!
* Filtering the necessary values for pivot table.

### ANALYSIS OF OUTCOME BASED ON LAUNCH DATES

* The campaign started with a low pace at the start of the year yet got to the best outcome within 4 months.
* April - May months saw the best coutcome for the year.
* It was followed by a steady decline till September.
* The year end for the campaign was mostly on low note.

### ANALYSIS OF OUTCOME BASED ON GOALS

* This analysis can be divided into two halves, cost of play below 25000 and above 25000.
* For first half, the percentage of success is higher compared to the other half. 
* The tendency of sucess is resting mostly with low costs.

## RESULTS

### CONCLUSION ABOUT OUTCOME BASED ON LAUNCH DATES

* Best time for the plays are months of April and May.
* Towards the end of the year there are very less viewership.

### COUCLUSION ABOUT OUTCOME BASED ON GOALS

* Percentage of success is more for plays of low cost.
* As cost increased, the percentage of success declined.

### LIMITATIONS OF THE DATASET

* Failed to address the age category of people who had the most views.
* No specific information regarding which category of people the play is aimed at.

### POSSIBLE TABLES / GRAPHS THAT CAN BE CREATED

* Outcome based on category
* Outcome based on country and currency
* Number of backers involoved
